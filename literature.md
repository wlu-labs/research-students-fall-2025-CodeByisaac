| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem Addressed | The lack of secure, standardized and interoperable communication protocol to enable bidirectional power flow (V2G) between electric vehicles and the grid. This survey explores how ISO15118 addresses this need, especially as it improves to support V2G applications | 
| Key Methodologies | - Detailed review of ISO15118 standard parts (1-7)<br> - Protocol stack analysis mapped to OSI layers<br> - Explanation of V2G specific message flows and cryptographic mechanisms <br> - Comparison of AC vs. DC V2G communication implications   | 
| Main Findings & Contributions | ISO15118 is foundational for enabling smart, secure EV grid integration<br> - Edition 2 introduces full bidirectional power transfer support<br> - Clarfies message exchanges for negotiation of charge/discharge parameters <br> - Distiction between on-board(AC) and off-board(DC) power converter roles<br> - Grid code compliance via parameterized communication with SECC   |
| Limitations & Open Questions | V2G capability is still limited by real world standard adoption and hardware readiness<br> - Grid codes inconsistencies |
| Relevance to Project | - Directly informs ISO15118 protocol handling inside EVerest <br>- Provides foundational understanding of ISO15118, Important for developing protocol aware optimization algorithms. <br>- Message structures and parameters like (ChargeParameterDiscovery, ACBidirectionalControlRes) give foundation for LLM based decision making |

## Key insight for project
* Protocol Aware Charging Profiles: ISO 15118-2(Edition 2) supports fine-grained communication for bidirectional power transfer, enabling intelligent charging/discharging control based on real time negotiation.
* Communication timing and message sequence are critical for safe V2G operation.  Layered message formats (V2GTP, EXI/XML, TLS). Ideal structure for LLM based parsing, anomaly detection in EV charging sessions.
* AC vs DC, complexity in AC V2G due to on-board converters presents a key use case for LLMs to assist with real time compliance decisions using semantic protocol interpreation.
